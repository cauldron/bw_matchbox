`bw_matchbox` is a web app for matching two [Brightway](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/). It allows you to do complicated matches, such as:

* Link process a to processes b and c, with allocation factors
* Link process a to a proxy for process b, changing the exchange values in b proxy to match those in process a where desired
* Link process a to a proxy for process b, removing some exchanges from b and adding some from a
* Link process a to a proxy for process b, expanding and inlining some exchanges from b to "flatten" its supply chain

## Installation

You can install _bw_matchbox_ via [pip] from [PyPI]:

```console
pip install bw_matchbox
```

It's possible to install the library itself for development purposes (in the cloned project):

```console
pip install -e .
```

This library depends on:

* Brightway 2.5 (`brightway25`)
* `docopt-ng`
* `flask` and `flask_httpauth`
* `tomli`
* `werkzeug`

## Usage

This is a `flask` application. Flask has a debug server suitable for development, but it [should not be used for production](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/deploying/)!

To use `bw_matchbox`, you need to do the following:

### Create a configuration file

Configuration is done via a `toml` file. See [`config_example.toml`](https://github.com/cauldron/bw_matchbox/blob/main/config_example.toml) for the structure of this file. Here is an example:

```toml
[users]
jane = "deer"
john = "doe"

[roles]
editors = ["jane"]
reviewers = ["john"]

[configs]
my_config = { project = "something", source = "database A", target = "database B", proxy = "database C"}

[files]
output_dir = "/Path/to/some/directory"
```

The `config.toml` file needs to provide the following:

* `[users]` section: Authentication, via a set of usernames and passwords
* `[roles]` section: The exact role labels must be used. Editors can make changes, reviewers can only comment.
* `[configs]` section: A combination of Brightway project and the source, target and proxy databases.
* `[files]` section: Currently only uses the `output_dir` key.

The easiest way to set this up is with:

```console
matchbox setup
```

This will create stub configuration and changes files in your current working directory - note that you should change the configuration and username/password in `config.toml`.

### Running the development server

Just run:

```console
matchbox webapp config.toml
```

### Running in production

You will need to configure the Flask app using `configure_app`, or re-implement its functionality. Here is an example using [waitress](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/index.html):

```python
from bw_matchbox import matchbox_app, configure_app
config_filepath = "/path/to/config.toml"
app = configure_app(config_filepath, matchbox_app)

from waitress import serve
serve(app, port=8080)
```

### Starting the app

Once the app is running and configured locally or remotely, connect to the correct address and port. If you are running locally, this is probably either `http://localhost:5000` or `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

In the first screen, choose the Brightway project you want to work on. This is `matchbox-example` if you ran `matchbox example_project`.

On the next screen, choose one database as the *source*, and **a different database** as the *target*. Currently you need to specify a new proxy database by typing a new database name into the *Create a new database* input box.
